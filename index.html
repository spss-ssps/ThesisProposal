        <h4>thesis proposal</h4>
        <p class="description">This project explores personal and ancestral memory through movement, archival media, and
            a wearable project. It investigates how traces of individual and inherited memory manifest in the body and
            rhythm.<br><br>
            In what ways can traces of personal and ancestral memory inhabit the body, and how can movement and
            technology make them perceptible and tangible?
        </p>

        <h2>Archival Website</h2>
        <p>This semester took a class called Medium of Memory with Simone Salvo where I started to explore these ideas.
        </p>
        <div class="media-section"> <img src="src/anue.gif" />
        </div>
        <p>I was interested in exploring how bodies and movement are imprinted over time. Showcasing it in this first
            project for the class:</p>

        <!-- Embedded websites -->

            <p class="description">Victoria Santa Cruz:<br>
                “rhythm is ‘the great organizer.’ It is key to our connection to the secrets of the organic cultures of
                the past. We can discover rhythm with the vehicle of the human body, never with the cold, colonizing
                intellect… the secret nature of rhythm, inherited from ancestral cultures, cannot be expressed through
                definitions (‘tempo,’ ‘beat,’ ‘meter,’ ‘movement,’ ‘order,’ etc.), for these definitions are only
                consequence of rhythm (just as dance is a consequence of rhythm).<br><br>Santa Cruz was a important
                figure
                in Afro-Peruvian culture and music.</p>

            <iframe src="https://enritmo.sofiasweb.art"></iframe>
            <p>As a final project I created this second website where I started to compile media and research on this
                topic. In the thesis iteration I am hoping it will function as a digital archive that organizes and
                visualizes collected media, movement studies, and research</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Wearables</h2>
        <p>For the wearable component of my thesis, I want it to reflect echoes of movement and
            memory. I plan to
            construct the garment using crochet or a similar textile technique, allowing the layering of material to
            mirror the accumulation of archival traces. This explorationg started with my NIME class where I am created
            a wearable intrument.</p>
        <div class="media-section"> <img src="src/NIMAProjectImg.jpeg" />
        </div>

        <h2>Performance</h2>
        <p>As a dancer, I want this project to have a performance component. I am considering combining live projection
            mapping of archival media onto the body with real-time body tracking, potentially using MediaPipe (or some
            sort of sensor to be built-in to the wearable). The projections will respond to the dancer’s movements,
            creating a dialogue
            between the performer and historical material.

                <source src="src/touch.mov" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>
        </div>
        <p>This is a touchdesigner and media pipe exploration, not necessarly to be a part of the peformance.</p>
